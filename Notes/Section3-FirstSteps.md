#### Jshell:

- jshell > System.out.print("Hello World");  -- This is called a statement in Java.

**Statement:** 

What is a statement?

* It's a complete command to be executed. It can include one or more expressions.
* What we've typed above, is a command to print some information to the screen, using syntax provided by the java language.
* We specified what we wanted java to print in the parenthesis and double quotes - in this case, the text "Hello World" 
  - effectively we're telling java to print out the words, as we've specified them in the quotes - "Hello World".

- Ctrl + C in Windows and Ctrl + D on MAC or Linux machine, should cancel what you are in the middle of, and get you 
  back to the Jshell prompt.
- /exit or /ex will end your Jshell session, if you get stuck.
